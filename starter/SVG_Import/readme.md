# Flag Game

This application has been designed to help students in high school remember flags and their
respective country names fun and pleasant manner.

TODOs:
[] The questions bank for all countries (initial version comes with a none complete list based on
the flags available)
[] The questions should be of two types:
[] type 1: show a flag and ask the user to select the corresponding country name from a list that
has four possible answers
[] type 2: have a country name and ask the user to select the corresponding flag (there should be 5
choices presented)
[] At the end of the game, a report should be presented to the user. This report should contain an
overview of the correctly recognized flags - country and the correct pair country and flag for the
questions that the user did not answer appropriately during the game phase. This history should be saved in a persistent data storage, and the user should have access to it when using the game later.
[] question loading:    the questions presented to the user should be optimized to satisfy the
primary requirement to help high school students remember the pairs of country names and flags.
Thus, the pair of flag-country names are recorded in the history as not mastered yet should be presented to the user in the next game round. And this should be as such until the user know each pair which will then trigger the removal of the couple from the history bank (meaning that it should no longer be shown when a new set of questions are presented)
